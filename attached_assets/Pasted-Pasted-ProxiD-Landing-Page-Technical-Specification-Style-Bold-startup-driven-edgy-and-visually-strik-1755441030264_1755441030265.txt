ProxiD Landing Page Technical Specification

Style: Bold, startup-driven, edgy, and visually striking
Audience: Startup founders, interns, freelancers, and HRs
Goal: Drive immediate sign-ups, create an emotional “wow” first impression, and communicate the product’s unique value in under 10 seconds.

1. Objectives

Present ProxiD as the go-to platform for talent and resource exchange between startups and companies.

Hook the audience emotionally and visually with Tinder-style swiping + Product Hunt-level clarity + Webflow Award aesthetics.

Increase registration conversion by 20–30% through bold design, snappy copy, and interactive features.

2. Page Structure & Content
Section 1 — Hero (First Screen)

Background: Dynamic WebGL particle animation — particles scatter and then form the ProxiD logo.

Tagline: A bold, slightly rebellious statement, e.g.
“Your startup won’t die from lack of people. Not on our watch.”

Primary CTA: “Try for Free” (pulsing effect).

Live interaction: A real-time vacancy swipe demo (mimicking Tinder swipes but with project cards).

Secondary CTA: “Watch 30s Demo” → triggers an in-page popup video walkthrough.

Section 2 — The Problem

Scroll effect: Parallax + neon glitch text appearing as you scroll.

Pain points displayed as bold stats:

“40% of employee time is wasted”

“67% of companies overpay for hiring”

“Interns take 3+ months to land a job”

Section 3 — The Solution

Video loop (8 sec): Show platform features — swiping, video resumes, bench board, analytics.

Punchy headline: “Work finds you. Not the other way around.”

Feature highlights with icons:

🎯 AI-matching — 89% accuracy

🎥 Video resumes — save time

🔄 Talent exchange between companies

📊 Real-time analytics & reporting

Section 4 — Who It’s For

Interactive slider: Options: “I’m a Founder / Intern / HR / Freelancer” → content updates instantly.

Tone: Playful yet relatable:

For Founders: “Our release is on fire. Our team is not. Let’s fix that.”

For Interns: “Get hired faster than you can say ‘portfolio’.”

Section 5 — Benefits

Visually appealing cards with hover effects:

“Speed — 60% faster hiring”

“See How It Works”

3. Design & Aesthetic Guidelines

Colors:

Primary background: #0B0B0B (dark)

Neon accents: #00F5A0 (mint green), #FF4B91 (pink)

Fonts: Bold grotesque typefaces (Inter, Poppins, or Manrope) with heavy weight for headings.

Effects:

Hover glow on buttons/icons.

Parallax scrolling transitions.

Neon glitch animation for section titles.

Smooth microinteractions for buttons and sliders.

4. Tone of Voice

Confident, witty, and concise.

Avoid corporate jargon — use emotional, fast, and action-oriented language.

Examples:

Instead of: “Optimized recruitment processes” → Say: “Hire without the headache.”

Instead of: “Networking opportunities” → Say: “Meet your next team over coffee, not over months.”
